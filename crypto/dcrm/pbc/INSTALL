This package must be compiled using cgo. It also requires the installation
of GMP and PBC. During the build process, this package will attempt to
include <gmp.h> and <pbc/pbc.h>, and then dynamically link to GMP and PBC.
It also expects a POSIX-like environment for several C functions. For this
reason, this package cannot be used in Windows without a POSIX compatibility
layer and a gcc compiler.

Most systems include a package for GMP. To install GMP in Debian / Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

For an RPM installation with YUM:

	sudo yum install gmp-devel

For installation with Fink (http://www.finkproject.org/) on Mac OS X:

	sudo fink install gmp gmp-shlibs

For more information or to compile from source, visit https://gmplib.org/

To install the PBC library, download the appropriate files for your system
from https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/download.html. PBC has three
dependencies: the gcc compiler, flex (http://flex.sourceforge.net/), and
bison (https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/). See the respective sites for
installation instructions. Most distributions include packages for these
libraries. For example, in Debian / Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison

The PBC source can be compiled and installed using the usual GNU Build
System:

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

After installing, you may need to rebuild the search path for libraries:

	sudo ldconfig

It is possible to install the package on Windows through the use of MinGW
and MSYS. MSYS is required for installing PBC, while GMP can be installed
through a package. Based on your MinGW installation, you may need to add
"-I/usr/local/include" to CPPFLAGS and "-L/usr/local/lib" to LDFLAGS when
building PBC. Likewise, you may need to add these options to CGO_CPPFLAGS
and CGO_LDFLAGS when installing this package.
